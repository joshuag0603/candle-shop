# <Candle-Shop>

## Description

This website was created as an example ecommerce site based around selling candles. The website allows users to add candles they want to order to their cart based on the quantity they select.  We built this project because it allowed us to work on both the front and back end sections of creating a fullstack application. During the project we learned the intricacies of working with React to run a front end, Postgres to run a database, and Node.js and Express.js to create routes and a server.

## Usage

![Home Page](assets/images/homePage.png)

The Home Page of the website displays the best selling candles and allows users to add those to their cart based on the quantity they choose from the quantity selector next to the "Add To Cart" button. The Home Page also has a navbar that takes the user to the Products Page, Cart Page, and back to the Home Page. 

The Products Page of the website displays all of the candles available in the shop and also allows users to add them to the cart just like on the Home Page. The same navbar from the Home Page is also featured on the Products Page. 

The Cart Page of the website displays the candles the user has added to the cart from the Home or Product Page. The user is also able to remove candles from the cart with the remove button. The same navbar from the previous two pages is also featured on the Cart Page.
